A well designed tensor network allow us to work and optimize the compressed representation without doing a complete decompression. It has proven successful so far: there are many commonly used networks that are applied to problem for which storing a complete representation of a wavefunction would require (several orders of magnitude) more memory than there is on earth.\n",

    "Tensor are objects that exist in vectors spaces. Tensors can be represented by multidimensionnal table of coefficients. Vector and Matrices are exemple of 1 dimensionnal and 2 dimensionnal tensors, respectively.\n",
