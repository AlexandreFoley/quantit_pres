    "Tensor networks allow us to work with a compressed representation of wave functions and operators. A well-designed tensor network allows us to work and optimize the compressed representation without doing a complete decompression. It has proven successful so far: there are many commonly used networks that are applied to problems for which storing a complete representation of a wave function would require several orders of magnitude more memory than there is on earth.\n",

    "Tensor are objects that exist in vector spaces. Tensors can be represented by a multidimensional table of coefficients. Vector and matrices are examples of rank-1 and rank-2 tensors, respectively.\n",

The presence of bonds in the MPS representation of the state gives us a lot of extra gauge degrees of freedom. By choosing the \"canonical\" gauge, the optimal solution to any single tensor is the solution of an eigenvalue problem.\n",
